# Week 4 Homework

This week, you'll modify a Rails app to add a Theater resource and all seven "CRUD" actions.

## Requirements

The homework folder contains an already-started Rails application containing the Movie resource we built in class.

Your assignment is to add a Theater resource to the app as well.

Notice that the code already has:

* A Theater model class
* A TheatersController controller class

But there's no migration yet, no routes, no views, and you'll need to write all of the controller action methods.

Take a look at the Theater model class.  It has instructions on the columns you'll need to create in your migration.

By the end, the user should be able create, edit, update, and delete Theaters.

(For this assignment, theaters are not related to movies in any way.)
